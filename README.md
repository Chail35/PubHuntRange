# PubHunt
_Hunt for Bitcoin public keys._

## It searches random compressed public keys for given hash160.

#
# The idea to do this

This is only useful for Bitcoin [puzzle transaction](https://www.blockchain.com/btc/tx/08389f34c98c606322740c0be6a7125d9860bb8d5cb182c02f98461e5fa6cd15).

Modified to Search for the public key within a given range.

For the puzzles, ```66```, ```67```, ```68```, ```69```, ```71``` or ```72``` and some more, there are no public keys are available, so if we can able to find public keys for those addresses, then [Pollard Kangaroo](https://github.com/JeanLucPons/Kangaroo) algorithm can be used to solve those puzzles.

That's it, cheers üç∫ 

# Usage

This is GPU only, no CPU support. 

```
./PubHunt -h
PubHunt [-check] [-h] [-v]
        [-gi GPU ids: 0,1...] [-gx gridsize: g0x,g0y,g1x,g1y, ...]
        [-o outputfile] [-sr startRange] [-er endRange] [inputFile]

 -v                       : Print version
 -gi gpuId1,gpuId2,...    : List of GPU(s) to use, default is 0
 -gx g1x,g1y,g2x,g2y, ... : Specify GPU(s) kernel gridsize, default is 8*(MP number),128
 -o outputfile            : Output results to the specified file
 -sr startRange           : Start of the key range to search
 -er endRange             : End of the key range to search
 -l                       : List cuda enabled devices
 -check                   : Check Int calculations
 inputFile                : List of the hash160, one per line in hex format (text mode)
```

For example:
```
./PubHunt -sr 2000000000000000 -er 3fffffffffffffff -o KeyFound.txt -gi 0 -gx 8192,1024 hash160.txt

PubHunt v1.00

DEVICE       : GPU
GPU IDS      : 0
GPU GRIDSIZE : 8192x1024
NUM HASH160  : 1
OUTPUT FILE  : KeyFound.txt
KEY RANGE    : 0x2000000000000000 - 0x3fffffffffffffff
GPU          : GPU #0 NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 (46x0 cores) Grid(8192x1024)

```

## Building
##### Windows
- Microsoft Visual Studio Community 2019 
- CUDA version 10.0
##### Linux
 - Edit the makefile and set up the appropriate CUDA SDK and compiler paths for nvcc. Or pass them as variables to `make` command.

    ```make
    CUDA       = /usr/local/cuda
    CXXCUDA    = /usr/bin/g++
    ```
 - To build with CUDA: pass CCAP value according to your GPU compute capability
    ```sh
    $ make CCAP=89 all
    ```
